## Application Developer, Harvard Law School, Cambridge, MA (2016 - 2020)
At Harvard Law School I serves as part of the Business Solutions team within the Internet Technology Services department. I supported the planning, development, and ongoing maintenance of a stable of internal applications supporting major elements of the school's day-to-day operations. Here I work alongside other departments to ensure the systems provided support their business needs as a part of the greater HLS community. Specific responsibilities included:
* hls.harvard.edu: Ongoing support and enhancement of the school's primary public website. **(Wordpress/PHP)**
* Faculty Bibliography: a new initiative to provide an indexed and searchable interface for accessing HLS Faculty scholarship. **(PHP/JSON/Elasticsearch)**
* Agresso: Internal Student Information System database administration as well as support of a custom API layer developed to expose the underlying database to numerous internal systems. **(C#)**

## Writer, Editor, and Webmaster - Haywire Magazine (2016 - 2020)
I originally joined Haywire(www.haywiremag.com) as a contributor, writing a monthly column that examined various topics through the lens of videogames. Playing For Real ran from April 2016 to July 2017, at which point I stepped down as a monthly columnist. My present role includes providing assistant editorial support for current writers and general technical assitance for setup and customization of the magazine's WordPress installation. 

## Research Fellow, Trinity Fellows Academy, Royal Oak, MD (2015 - 2016)
As a Research Fellow at TFA, I pursued self-guided research under the guidance of Dr. Syman Stevens and Dr. Laura Cook-Kenna. My focus was the anthropological role of play in human society and its applications in the development of videogames. I produced a written thesis and supporting essays published at the online videogame criticism journal First Person Scholar as well as the games and culture webzine Haywire Magaine. Along with my own research, I served in a writing group with two other Fellows, providing significant feedback, brainstorming, and proofreading for their own research theses.

On a weekly basis I served as support staff for the Osprey Point Retreat and Convention Center, learning to develop my hospitality and servant leadership skills under the General Manager, Roger Valentine. This work is a fully integrated part of TFA's vision for developing the character and attitude needed to truly be a great leader in any field. I also helped to provide this same hospitality and service to lecturers and guests visiting TFA, acted as Logistics Coordinator for three major weekend conferences that the TFA Fellows hosted, and oversaw all work shift scheduling for the year.

## Application Developer, InterSystems Corporation, Cambridge, MA (2011-2015)
At InterSystems I worked under Benjamin Spead on the Application Services team, using ISC technology to develop and maintain tools for use within the company. Much of my day-to-day efforts were dedicated to supporting multiple mission-critical applications used throughout the company. My tasks ranged from triage and categorization of newly reported bugs to meeting with end users to develop specifications for requested features and enhancements.

Projects that I contributed to include InterSystems' change control and workflow management application, a facilities management ticketing and issue tracker, a Customer Relations Managment application, and a contractor directory and workflow manager.

I worked extensively with InterSystems technologies such as Caché , Ensemble, ObjectScript, Zen, and Caché Server Pages (CSP), as well as standard web development technologies such as HTML, JavaScript, and CSS for client-side functionality and DOM manipulation.

InterSystems' Change Control Record, a workflow and version control management application I helped develop during my time there, was named the best use of Perforce Helix in Medical Technology (for its use with InterSystems TrakCare) at the 2016 Versionary Awards, presented during the Perforce MERGE conference.

## Sweezy Research Fellow, Grove City College, Grove City, PA (2009)
As part of Grove City College's Sweezy Fellowship Research Experience for Undergraduates program, I worked with a team of three other students alongside Dr. Christiaan Gribble pursuing research in ray tracing. The project involved significant experience coding, both within a conventional UNIX environment and for specialized DSP hardware (SPI's Storm-I).

Our efforts saw the successful creation of a fully-functional ray tracing engine to facilite research in both fixed and floating-point environments, as well as a peer-reviewed paper published in the Journal of Graphics, GPU, and Game Tools and a poster at ACM SIGGRAPH/Eurographics High Performance Graphics. (See Portfolio)

My personal contributions involved working on the fixed-point mathematics libraries needed to facilitate our work the the DSP, as well as contributions to the design and implementation of the core ray-tracing engine. I also contributed to the writing and editing of the JGT article.
